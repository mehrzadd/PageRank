# PageRank

Input:
from the command line the name of the edge list file of a directed graph and two floating-point values for Alpha and Beta. For example:

python PageRank.py MyDigraph.txt 3.0 1.0

Recall that, in the edge list file of a directed graph, an edge is represented by two vertex indices, x and y, meaning there is an edge from vertex x to vertex y.

Output: to the standard output the PageRank centralities of all vertices with their indices:

[0]  0.37326

[1]  1.07425

[2]  0.27836

[3]  2.62004
